first here need to create one object named transaction daily report
inside that 
thransactionDate, totalSuccessAmount and totalFailedAmount 
and need to send data in list as transactionFailure and inside that

failureReason and failureamount and fauilure percentage will be there failure percentage will be totalFailedAmount/failureAmount*100

Jan-2025	CUSTOMER	117
Jan-2025	BUSINESS	78
Jan-2025	TECHNICAL	39
this type of data I'll get by
SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(TRANSACTION_DATE, 'DD-MM-YY'), 'Mon-YYYY') as transactionDate, error_code as failureReason, sum(failure_amount) as failureAmount FROM view_transaction_daily_failure_report WHERE MID = 1000834 AND error_code is NOT NULL AND TRANSACTION_DATE BETWEEN TO_DATE('1-01-2025', 'DD-MM-YYYY') AND TO_DATE('31-01-2025', 'DD-MM-YYYY') GROUP BY TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(TRANSACTION_DATE, 'DD-MM-YY'), 'Mon-YYYY'),error_code;

and
Jan-2025	22	12
this I'll get by
SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(TRANSACTION_DATE, 'DD-MM-YY'), 'Mon-YYYY') as transactionDate, SUM(total_success_amount) as totalSuccessAmount, sum(total_failed_amount) as toalFailedAmount FROM view_transaction_daily_report WHERE MID = 1000834 AND TRANSACTION_DATE BETWEEN TO_DATE('1-01-2025', 'DD-MM-YYYY') AND TO_DATE('31-01-2025', 'DD-MM-YYYY') GROUP BY TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(TRANSACTION_DATE, 'DD-MM-YY'), 'Mon-YYYY');


now I need to calculate the percentage in code and build the object
